        <h2 >Strategy</h2>
        <p >Perform an inventory of your information systems and document the sources of your data; assess data management processes, tools, and vendors.</p>
        <p >Identify which systems are the primary source of specific data, such as customer information, and which should be used by or feed other systems or reports.</p>
        <p >Work with you to create the data architecture to best collect, cleanse, transform, and store your data to easily access and perform analysis and reporting; chart a data management roadmap.</p>
        <h2 >Implementation</h2>
        <p >Combine data from disparate sources; validate and cleanse if necessary.</p>
        <p >Create and implement policies and procedures to ensure data is collected accurately.</p>
        <p >Implement change management process with your teams to ensure changes are clearly communicated and managed properly so that data integrity is maintained.</p>
        <p >Create documentation such as data dictionaries, which clearly identify the sources of each data element, any cleansing, transformation or enhancements that have occurred, and precise definitions so that others can use the data correctly.</p>
        <p >Design database solutions and create the necessary programs to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various sources into a data warehouse.</p>
        <h2 >Optimization</h2>
        <p >Align with data governance program to ensure smooth operations and continuous improvements.</p>
        <p >Monitor data warehouse and databases uptime and availability.</p>
        <p >Evaluate and perfect ETL processes to minimize errors and load time.</p>
        <p >Track data quality success. Setup automated data quality assurance monitoring.</p>
        <p >Ongoing change management for optimal speed, breadth, and quality of project implementation.</p>
